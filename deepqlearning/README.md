# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Financial Planning

Train an AI agent to make financial decisions over a person's lifetime. The agent learns to manage bank accounts, retirement funds, debt, and lifestyle choices to maximize long-term financial well-being.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r ../requirements.txt requirements-rl.txt
```

### 2. Train Your First Agent
```bash
# Basic training scenario (recommended for beginners)
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic --episodes 1000

# High earner scenario
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario high_earner --episodes 1500
```

### 3. Interactive Tutorial
For a step-by-step walkthrough, open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook RL_Training_Example.ipynb
```

## üéØ Training Scenarios

Choose from pre-configured financial scenarios:

- **`basic`** - Standard middle-class income profile (great for learning)
- **`high_earner`** - High income with complex investment decisions
- **`low_earner`** - Limited income requiring careful budgeting
- **`mid_career`** - Starting training from age 35-40

## üõ†Ô∏è Training Options

### Basic Training
```bash
# Train with default settings
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic

# Train for specific number of episodes
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario high_earner --episodes 2000
```

### Continue Training from Saved Model
```bash
# Load and continue training an existing model
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic --load_model models/financial_dqn_basic.pt --episodes 500
```

### Evaluation Only
```bash
# Evaluate a trained model without additional training
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic --eval_only --load_model models/financial_dqn_basic.pt
```

### Generate Training Plots
```bash
# Display training progress plots
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic --plot_results

# Save plots to file
python train_financial_agent.py --scenario basic --plot_results --save_plots plots/basic_training.png
```

## üéÆ How It Works

1. **State Observation** - Agent sees financial situation (account balances, debt, income, age, etc.)
2. **Action Selection** - Chooses from 20+ financial actions (transfers, withdrawals, lifestyle changes)
3. **Reward Feedback** - Gets rewarded for good financial outcomes, penalized for poor decisions
4. **Learning** - Updates its strategy based on experience

## üîß Customizing Training

### Modify Scenarios
Edit the scenario configurations in `train_financial_agent.py` to adjust:
- Starting financial conditions
- Income profiles
- Training duration
- Model architecture

### Adjust Reward Function
Modify the reward calculation in `environment.py` to emphasize different objectives:
- Wealth accumulation vs. spending satisfaction
- Early retirement vs. financial security
- Risk tolerance levels

### Add New Actions
Extend the action space in `actions.py` to include:
- New account types
- Investment strategies
- Life decisions (career changes, education, etc.)
