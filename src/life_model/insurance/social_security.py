# The Social Security Administration uses a complex formula to calculate your
# Social Security benefits. Here's a simplified version of how it works:

# Calculate Your Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME): The Social Security
# Administration takes your 35 highest-earning years (adjusted for inflation),
# adds them up, and then divides by the total number of months in those years
# to get your AIME.

# Apply the Bend Point Formula: The Social Security Administration then applies
# a formula to your AIME to calculate your Primary Insurance Amount (PIA). As
# of 2021, the formula is:

# 90% of the first $996 of your AIME, plus
# 32% of your AIME over $996 and up to $6,002, plus
# 15% of your AIME over $6,002
# The dollar amounts in the formula (known as "bend points") are adjusted each
# year for inflation.

# Adjust for Early or Late Retirement: If you start taking benefits before your
# full retirement age (which depends on your birth year), your monthly benefit
# will be reduced. If you delay taking benefits past your full retirement age,
# your monthly benefit will be increased.

# Cost-of-Living Adjustments (COLAs): Once you start receiving benefits, they
# will be adjusted each year for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for
# Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W).

# The Social Security Administration has a more detailed explanation of how
# benefits are calculated.
